# Brownian Motion Displacement Simulation
Brownian motion is a natural phenomenon where a small particle might move randomly in any direction.

This program takes in an input `N` for the number of rounds to simulate, and then perform the simulation where in each round, it moves the particle by 1 unit of distance in a random direction. At the end, it reports the distance between the origin and the particle. The final displacement is expected to be proportional to square root of `N` in theory.
